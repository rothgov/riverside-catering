    <p class="lh-copy">At Riverside Catering we believe that we have a responsibility to help children learn to value the food on their plate. To achieve this we use only the best locally sourced and seasonal ingredients.</p>
    <p class="lh-copy">Our development chefs continually strive to find new, improved and attractive menu items. They work hard to strive for a balance between traditional favourites and new and exciting tastes. They explore imaginative ways of presenting and serving our food to make it easy for even the youngest pupils to select and enjoy a meal.</p>
    <p class="lh-copy">To gain a place on our menus each dish must look appetising, taste delicious and contribute to the achievement of a balanced diet. Above all it must appeal to a wide variety of individual tastes. Sample menus 2017-2018 (provide link).</p>
    <p class="lh-copy">To make the best of seasonal produce we change our menus twice each year. Spring brings the light freshness of salads, roasted meats and cold sweets. Autumn welcomes the comfort of hearty casseroles and hot puddings.</p>
