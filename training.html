      <p class="lh-copy f4 br-blue">We recognise that the workforce is our most important resource. As well as being directly responsible for delivering your service they are often considered to be 'part of the school'.</p>
      <p class="lh-copy">Staff training and development is a subject we are passionate about. In addition to a host of in house training all staff are provided with access to a range of accredited training activities designed to enhance the service that we can offer to your school.</p>
