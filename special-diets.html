    <p class="lh-copy f4 br-blue">We can cater for children with prescribed medical diets, formally diagnosed food allergies as well as cultural diets and have robust processes in place for arranging their supply and delivery.</p>
    <p class="lh-copy">In order to ensure that we provide meals that meet with your child's needs we will need to meet with parent/carers/dieticians to discuss individual requirements. Medical evidence in the form of letters from GP, paediatric dietician will be required.</p>
    <p class="lh-copy">Please contact Riverside Catering on 01709 822312 to arrange an appointment with your local Area Catering Manager.</p>
