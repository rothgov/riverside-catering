      <h3 class="f4 mb0 br-blue">Kim Phillips</h3>
      <p class="b br-blue mt2">Head of Catering &amp; Facilities Services</p>
      <p class="lh-copy measure">Kim has over 25 years in senior management positions within different public authorities, providing commercial management of services to internal and external customers.</p>
      <p class="lh-copy measure">With professional qualifications in procurement, contract and business management, Kim is able to understand the customer need for commercial efficiency within a public sector environment.</p>
      <p class="lh-copy measure">Kim joined Rotherham Metropolitan Borough Council in 2005 to lead the soft facilities management provision, with a remit to expand the traded services in this area. This objective has been challenging with the customer landscape changing with the move to Multi Academy Trusts. However, the continuous review of customer requirements and clear focus on quality outcomes as a unique selling point has enabled customer retention and growth.</p>
      <p class="lh-copy measure">Prior to RMBC Kim was the Commercial Manager for Business &amp; Education Together, working with schools and colleagues to provide support through activities to develop young peopleâ€™s skills, capabilities and employability.</p>
      <p class="lh-copy measu">Kim also spent 16 years with South Yorkshire Police, the later years as the Business Manager of District Command Units which offered significant challenges in ensuring emergency and 24 hour operational cover for staffing whilst remaining within an agreed budget target.</p>
