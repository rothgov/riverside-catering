      <h3 class="f4 f4-m f3-l mt3 lh-copy b br-purple mb0">Building your trip</h3>
      <p class="lh-copy mt1">Our instructors will liaise with you to ensure the activities meet the requirements of the national curriculum, providing fun and educational outdoor activities appropriate to key stage 2, 3 and 4.</p>
      <p class="lh-copy mt1">Based in the Peak District, it is easy for us to tailor the course to fit in subjects such as PE where we can look at climbing skills, balance and co-ordination, water sports and navigation.</p>
      <p class="lh-copy mt1">We can also build in numeracy, literacy, problem solving and topic work such as water and the environment as the Centre borders a Site of Special Scientific Interest at Upper Longdendale, Special Protection Area and Brockholes Wood Nature Reserve.</p>
      <p class="lh-copy mt1">Courses can be linked to accredited outcomes such as The Duke of Edinburgh's Award or other relevant courses.</p>
      <h3 class="f4 f4-m f3-l mt3 lh-copy b br-purple mb0">Tailored to meet your needs</h3>
      <p class="lh-copy mt1">The Centre offers full or part week residential outdoor activity programmes or a daily activity programme.</p>
      <p class="lh-copy mt1">The programme can include evening activities however, you may wish to use this time to undertake your own activities or reflections to support cross curriculum activity.</p>
      <h3 class="f4 f4-m f3-l mt3 lh-copy b br-purple mb0">Why choose Crowden for your pupils?</h3>
      <ul class="lh-copy">
        <li>It is an ideal chance for children to gain the personal, social and health benefits of a residential experience</li>
        <li>It is a chance for them to learn “lifeskills” outside the boundaries of a classroom</li>
        <li>It is an opportunity for them to broaden their horizons and take part in activities that they may not ordinarily do</li>
        <li>Staying away from home allows children to get away from their immediate environment and opens up a variety of new experiences and learning opportunities</li>
        <li>It enables children to return to the classroom with a new found sense of confidence, self awareness and an increased willingness to try something new</li>
      </ul>
