    <h3 class="voltaire f3 mb0 br-blue ttu">Eligibility</h3>
    <p class="lh-copy">Your child is eligible for Free School Meals if you get one or more of the following benefits:</p>
    <ul class="lh-copy">
      <li>Income Support</li>
      <li>Income-based Job Seekers' Allowance</li>
      <li>Income-related Employment and Support Allowance</li>
      <li>Support under Part VI of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999</li>
      <li>The Guaranteed element of State Pension Credit</li>
      <li>Child Tax Credit, provided you are not also entitled to Working Tax Credit, and have an annual gross income, of no more than £16,190 (as of 2014 financial year) as assessed by Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs</li>
      <li>Working Tax Credit run-on - paid for four weeks after you stop qualifying for Working Tax Credit</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="lh-copy">It is important that you continue to apply for Free School Meals even if your child is in Key Stage 1 as this enables your child’s school to access Pupil Premium which is an important payment for schools which enables them to get even more support for the children in school.</p>
    <p class="lh-copy">If your child is in Key Stage 1 and you do not apply, your child's school will not be able to claim the appropriate child premium and will have less money to spend on supporting children in school.</p>
    <p class="lh-copy">Please do not give up claiming if you think you qualify or if your child already has a free school meals. Simply apply on line.</p>
