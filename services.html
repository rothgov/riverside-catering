        <h3 class="voltaire f3 mb0 br-blue ttu">Breakfast Clubs</h3>
        <p class="lh-copy mt2">It has been suggested that breakfast is the most important meal of the day, yet it is the meal most regularly missed by children. Studies have shown that eating breakfast can improve a child’s problem solving abilities, memory, concentration levels, visual perception and creative thinking. Punctuality and school attendance can also improve.</p>
        <p class="lh-copy">A nourishing breakfast may mean that children are tempted to reduce their intake of confectionery. We can encourage your pupils to enjoy the benefits of a healthy breakfast by providing a breakfast service at your school if required.</p>
