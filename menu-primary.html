      <p class="lh-copy">We have a variety of menus ranging from a single choice up to 4 choices depending on individual school requirements all of which comply with strict nutritional standards that are set nationally by the Government.</p>
      <p class="lh-copy">As a busy parent, we know how valuable your time is. Research published in 2010 by Dr Charlotte Evans from Leeds University revealed that only 1% of packed lunches met the nutritional standards that currently apply to school food. A school lunch is lower in salt, sugar and higher in nutrients than the average packed lunch so you can be sure that your child is having a nutritionally balanced meal.</p>
