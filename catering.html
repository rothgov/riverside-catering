      <p class="lh-copy f4 br-blue">We are committed to providing the highest level of hospitality to our customers. We provide great food for any occasion, freshly made on-site by our school catering teams. Whether your event is a teacher training day, school prom or breakfast meeting our catering team is available to meet your hospitality requirements.</p>
      <p class="lh-copy">We use locally sourced and produced ingredients wherever possible.</p>
      <p class="lh-copy">All of our food options contain choices that are suitable for vegetarian diets and we will cater specifically for food allergies and other dietary requirements.</p>
      <p class="lh-copy">If our menus do not meet your needs, we will be pleased to discuss a personalised menu with you. We provide a range of food from a simple working lunch to a three course meal should you require.</p>
